# Movies Recommendation
#### Unsupervised Learning
#### K-Means Clustering

### Build

Before run this project, it's necessary have been installed the following libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

Besides, you need a [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to build it.

### Project

Say you're a data analyst at Netflix and you want to explore the similarities and differences 
in people's tastes in movies based on how they rate different movies. Can understanding these 
ratings contribute to a movie recommendation system for users? Let's dig into the data and see.

### Dataset Overview

The data we'll be using comes from the wonderful [MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) [user rating dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
We'll be looking at individual movie ratings later in the notebook, but let us start with 
how ratings of genres compare to each other.

The dataset has two files.
- movies.csv
- ratings.csv
